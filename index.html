                media marketing is no exception.
                Ideally, you should use SMART goals, which in other words means that your goals should be specific,

        <ol>
            <h3>The first step to creating quality content is to identify what type of information will be useful to
                your audience. Remember that your content must be entertaining
                <br> and visually pleasing, as users will look at all these details to evaluate it.
                <br> Also, do not forget that users do not like to be saturated with the same information, much less if
                it is only information from your company. Give them something that
                <br> interests them and above all that is useful.
                <br> On the other hand, you should take into account that, just as creating quality content takes time
                and effort, the ideal thing is to share it in the most possible channels
                <br> so that it reaches as many potential customers as possible.

                <br> For example, on Facebook they are not useful because nobody searches for hashtags on this social
                network,
                <br> while on Instagram you have the option to search by hashtag and all the relevant content regarding
