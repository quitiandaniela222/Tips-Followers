    <h1> success stories of freelancers and companies in social networks </h1>
    <h3>Companies that have been able to take advantage of social networks in very
        different sectors.
        Because it doesn't matter so much what sector your business is in, it matters to detect your target audience and
        offer them the content they demand on each of the platforms.</h3>

    <h3>The concept of "virality" in networks is something sought by many but achieved by few. This does not mean that
        any user cannot achieve it but, in addition to meeting certain social factors,
        <br>it is very important that we have a certain degree of "luck" in this regard.

    <h2> Ester Expósito </h2>
    <ol>
        <h3> <br> Known for her role in the Netflix series "Elite." Who was going to tell this girl that, after posting
            a dancing video on her Instagram account, it would be a success on this social
            <br>network and would become the most viewed in the world. We leave the post below so you can take a look.

            alt="followers" width="450" height="300" />
        <br> In just a few days, this publication of Ester dancing reggaeton in her room during the quarantine
        accumulated millions of views and is currently about to reach 95 million, in addition
        <br> to 11 million likes and 300,000 comments. As she commented in her interview on the La Resistencia program,
        she herself did not expect such a simple video to have such an impact. She
        <br> herself commented on said program that she longed to be able to party with her friends and for this reason,
        together with the boredom of confinement due to COVID-19, was why she made the publication.
        <br> But at no time did I expect the post to go as far as it has managed to do.

    <h3>
        <br> After this publication, if we take a look at his statistics from the SocialBlade website, his account has
        exploded on Instagram, reaching almost 30 million followers. This tool allows us to know the flow of followers,
        <br> among other statistics of certain social accounts on the Internet, but normally, we do not find growth of
        this type no matter how much we investigate through it. So, in addition to having the most viewed video on this
        app, it is also the Spanish profile with the most followers on Instagram.

    <h3>
        <br> It has achieved 50 million views which, despite being a spectacular figure, is well below Ester Expósito's
        video. What's more, referring to the publication of the Spanish actress, when Kylie Jenner verified that she had
        "snatched" her position, she sent a congratulatory message to Ester.
